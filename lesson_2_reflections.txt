What happens when you initialize a repository?
	
	A .git file is created and all the files in the folder becomes part of my repository.

Why do you need to do it?

	I need a repository to commit my changes for VC.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area contains only the files that you want to commit, the repository is all your files in the working directory.
